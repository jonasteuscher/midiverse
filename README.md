# midiverse
Midiverse is an immersive audiovisual installation that transforms live piano or keyboard performances into a real-time generative visual experience. Using MIDI input and TouchDesigner, each keystroke becomes a visual element—projected dynamically onto a wall via a beamer—bringing music to life in a unique and expressive way.
