# Midiverse – Real-Time Piano Visualization

## Short Description
*Midiverse* is an immersive audiovisual installation that transforms live piano or keyboard performances into a real-time generative visual experience. Using MIDI input and TouchDesigner, each keystroke becomes a visual element—projected dynamically onto a wall via a beamer—bringing music to life in a unique and expressive way.

## Full Project Description
**Midiverse** bridges the gap between sound and sight by mapping MIDI data from a digital piano or MIDI keyboard to a custom visual system built in TouchDesigner. The project listens to MIDI note events, velocity, duration, and even harmonic structures, then translates them into reactive visuals in real-time.

Each note or chord triggers a corresponding visual—ranging from glowing pulses to flowing particles or geometric transformations. The system allows for multiple layers of abstraction: lower notes might ripple the visual field like waves, while higher notes could create bursts of light or trails across the projection surface.

The installation is designed to be performed live and projected via a beamer onto a large wall, allowing the audience to **see** the music as it unfolds. *Midiverse* is ideal for concerts, interactive exhibitions, or creative studios where audiovisual art and performance intersect.

## Key Features
- Real-time MIDI input from any keyboard or digital piano  
- Note-based and velocity-sensitive visual mappings  
- Customizable visual styles (e.g. ambient particles, geometry, waveform distortion)  
- Scalable projection for small rooms or large stages  
- Optional control over visual presets via MIDI CC or keyboard  

## Tools Used
- TouchDesigner  
- MIDI Keyboard (e.g. 88-key digital piano)  
- Beamer/projector  
- Optional: MIDI CC foot pedal or external controller for switching visual modes  

## Vision
*Midiverse* is not just a tool for musicians—it's a canvas for musical storytelling. It enables performers to create not only music but visual poetry in motion.
